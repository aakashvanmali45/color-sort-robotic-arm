# Color Sorting Robotic Arm using MATLAB

## Overview
Designed and analyzed a robotic arm capable of sorting objects based on color.

## Features
- Programmed the robotic arm using MATLAB Simulink and relevant libraries.
- Successfully sorted red, green, and blue cube-shaped objects into separate piles.
- Integrated:
  - Mechanical design of the robotic arm
  - Image processing for color detection
  - Vacuum gripper for object manipulation
- Demonstrated the seamless integration of image processing, robotics, and control systems.
